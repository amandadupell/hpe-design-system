## Guidance

Everything that you need to know about toasts and more.

### When should you use a Toast Notification?

Toasts should be considered when displaying these types of information to the user:

- Low attention messages that do not require user action
- Singular status updates
- Confirmations
- Information that does not need to be followed up

Do not use Toasts if the information contains the following:

- High attention and crtitical information
- Time-sensitive information
- Requires user action or input
- Batch updates

Due to their limited use cases, toasts are advised to be used sparingly or even substituted entirely for a different type of notification. In no way are toasts mandatory elements for a platform’s notification system.

## Anatomy 

<ToastDiagram />

Toasts are compromised of three main elements:

1. Status Indicator
2. Content (Title + Message)
3. Close button

Aside from this, all toasts have a fixed width size at Medium (384px) while the height changes based off the amount of content. 

### Status Indicator

Avoid using toasts for very critical information or alerts. Users may accidentally dismiss or entirely miss a toast, so it is best to avoid this case for important information. Additionally, avoid using toasts, critical or not, if it requires a user action. 

The status indicators used for toasts are strictly for OK, Warning, and Unknown statuses.

<Box direction="row" gap="medium" pad={{bottom: 'medium'}}>
    <StatusGoodSmall color="status-ok" />
    <StatusWarningSmall color="status-warning" />
    <StatusUnknownSmall color="status-unknown" />
</Box>

You can read more guidance about [status indicators](/components/status-indicator).

### Content (Title + Message)

All toasts have content which is comprised of a title and a message. However, the content only requires a title, not necessarily a message. The title and message should be distinguishable from each other by the weight of the text. The status title and message should be distinguishable by the weight of the text.

1. Amount of Information

Toast notifications should not have too much information inside of them. Additionally, each notification should only revolve around one idea or subject. Because a toast notification is only present on the screen for a short amount of time, a user using assistive technology needs to have an understanding of what information is in the notification. Therefore, the content should be minimal and direct.

For best practice, keep the amount of information to three lines or under. This three line limit either can be a combination of both the title and the message or a three-lined title. If the information is heavy and long, consider using a different type of notification other than toast. Never truncate text within a toast. The main point is to keep the information concise and clear.

2. Interactive Content

Avoid placing interactive elements as this violates WCAG 2.1 guidelines, like links and buttons, inside of a toast. These elements may be difficult to access with a screen reader and other assistive technology, so it is best to avoid complex toasts.

### Close Button

The close button within a toast should be the only interactable element and is used to dismiss the notification. To clarify, the toast itself is not dismissable on click rather only when the close button is specifically activated. This is to avoid any confusion the user may have on what the interactable elements are within a toast.

## Placement 

Make sure to follow these guidelines for Toast Notifications:
- Place them either top-center or top-right of the screen. If badging is being used, toasts should be placed underneath it. Note that top-right placements may negatively affect those using screen magnifiers.
- Fade in on arrival and fade out when dismissed.
- Do not obscure critical information and any primary action elements.
- Toasts are not focused on and do not appear when a user is within a Modal or Wizard since they do not carry high attention information. 
- List them when there are multiple with the latest toast being on top. Toasts automatically dismiss if it reaches a certain point on the user’s screen. 
- Reminder that toasts should not be used to convey a batch of information as this would quickly hinder their visibility and cause notification fatigue.
- For multiple incoming toasts, consider incorporating a Notification Center where a user can access all the information at once.
