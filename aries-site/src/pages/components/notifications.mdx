### What are they for?

Notifications build trust by providing users confidence and assurance that they are informed with timely, relevant status about their systems and tasks.

## Taxonomy 

To standardize language for Notifications across HPE projects, be sure to familiarize yourself with this taxonomy:

- **Type** - In the broadest terms, what the notification is about
- **State** - The current stage within a process
- **Status** - The condition of a process
- **Attention Level** - The priority and importance of a notification
- **Actions** - Interactactions within a notification
- **Persistence** - How the notification is dismissed
- **Placement** - Where the notification can be found
- **Insight** - The content of the notification

| Type        | State       | Status   | Attention Level | Actions | Persistence     | Placement | Insight              |
| ------------| ------------|----------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Information | In-Progress | Critical | High            | Dismiss | Dismissable     | Banner    | Support              |
| Task        | Starting    | Normal   | Medium          | Read    | Clearable       | Browser   | Progress Update      |
| Event       | Stopped     | Warning  | Low             | Unread  | Action Required | Email     | Status/Task Tracking |
|             | Pending     | Unknown  |                 | Yes     |                 | Toast     | Created              |
|             | Success     |          |                 | No      |                 | Bell      | Required Received    |
|             | Failure     |          |                 |         |                 | Badging   |                      |
|             |             |          |                 |         |                 | System    |                      |
|             |             |          |                 |         |                 | Global    |                      |
|             |             |          |                 |         |                 | Inline    |                      |

### State v.s. Status

A state is the current stage of a process.

A status is the condition of the state. Status can also be thought of as a pointer to a state’s “health”. 

Here is an example of a Toast Notification that illustrates their differences:

Keep in mind that a status DERIVES from a state.

## Roadmap

The Design System is currently exploring and researching best practices and considerations for notification patterns. Here are some things we have lined out for the future:

- Banner
- Global
- System
- Inline
- Notification center
- Badging & Bell

## Notification Systems

The following types of notifications are used to provide users with full transparent clarity on tasks and system statuses:

- [Status Indicators](/components/status-indicator) are used within all types of notifications. They capture user’s attention based on the notification’s level of severity
- For low priority and non action oriented notifications, [Toast Notifications](/components/toast-notifications) are a great way to inform users unobtrusively.
